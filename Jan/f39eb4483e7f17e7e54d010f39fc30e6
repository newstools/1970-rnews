Once again now former Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, is heading to the courts on Monday to fight his dismissal from the power utility.Molefe left Eskom in November last year under a cloud following damning allegations against him in the Public Protector's State Capture Report. He was cited as being too close to the controversial Gupta family, whose company, Tegeta, has lucrative deals with Eskom.He was then deployed to Parliament as an African National Congress (ANC) MP.Following a public outcry after the Eskom Board indicated it was going to pay him a R30 million severance package, negotiations apparently failed, and to the shock of everyone - even the ANC, Molefe was re-appointed as CEO of Eskom at the end of April.Apparently, he had been mistakenly granted early retirement, which entitled him to the R30 million package, which was vetoed by Public Enterprises Minister, Lynne BrownHe also resigned from his position as an ANC MP.Following weeks of drama, the Eskom Board bowed to pressure and fired Molefe on Friday. In giving effect to and on the basis of the minister s directive contained in the letter dated May 31, 2017, it was resolved that the resolution of the board of directors taken on May 2, 2017 is rescinded. Furthermore, it was resolved that the reinstatement agreement concluded between Mr Molefe and Eskom on May 11, 2017 be rescinded, the board said in a statement. Now he is taking Eskom and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown to the Labour Court over his dismissal.Apparently, when Molefe left Eskom last year, he had not resigned but had asked for an early retirement - so the outcry about his return is misplaced.
