With the real estate market currently being more friendly to homebuyers than to sellers, many owners are thinking about altering or adding on to their existing properties rather than trying to sell and move to a different home.However, says Rob Allan, owners of the RealNet franchise in Randburg, this is really not an easy choice, and homeowners should weigh up the answers to the following seven questions before making a final decision to stay put or relocate:"If you live in an area of smaller homes favoured by first-time buyers, for example, an expensive renovation or upgrade does not make sense, because it is very unlikely that you will ever be able to sell your home at a high enough price to recoup the cost of your improvements. This is especially true in the current phase of the market, when home values are only rising very slowly, notes Allan. Consequently, you need to be sure you will live there long enough for the value of the property to rise sufficiently to cover these costs. This time period will vary depending on the price of the property and the performance of the market overall, but is usually between five and seven years meaning that if you sell again before that, you could end up losing money by moving. Otherwise you might as well put your budget towards the purchase of a bigger home.
