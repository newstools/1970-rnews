The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Amathole District Municipality on Tuesday said that it rejects the appointment of Thandekile Mnyimba as the Municipality s new Municipal Manager because of his alleged fraudulent past.Mnyimba was a Municipal Manager at the failed Ikwezi Local Municipality, which was later amalgamated into the Dr Beyers Naude Local Municipality in 2016, before being re-deployed to the Oudtshoorn Local Municipality, despite being judged the least suitable of the five candidates, who were shortlisted and interviewed for the position .During Mnyimba s tenure at Ikwezi, from 2007 to 2011, the municipality only achieved either Disclaimers or Qualified Audit Opinions. Things did not pan out well for him in Oudtshoorn either."Mr Mnyimba was dismissed from Oudtshoorn Municipality after his qualifications were exposed as fraudulent," said Thabisa Goniwe-Mafanya - a DA Amathole District Municipality PR Councillor."We call on the Eastern Cape MEC for Cooperate Governance and Traditional Affairs, Fikile Xasa, to nullify this appointment with immediate effect to avoid further damage to the effective management of the municipality."Mr Thandekile Mnyimba does not only have a fraud case pending against him, he also lacks the requisite experience required for this post. He only has 2 years experience in senior management instead of the requisite 5 years that are required for MM position."Mafanya said that the DA strongly opposes his appointment to the position, which has a R1.7 million annual salary, as it believes there are far more qualified candidates, who were overlooked for this position."Section 54a(2) of the Municipal Systems Act, makes explicitly clear the requirements and skills required for one to be appointed as a Municipal Manager. Thandekile Mnyimba substantially falls short of these requirements making him unsuitable for the post," he argues."African National Congress (ANC)-run Municipalities continue to compromise service delivery by pursuing a cadre deployment policy that appoints unqualified people to critical positions."Mnyimba s appointment needs to be rescinded as soon as possible if the municipality s poor governance fundamentals are to be corrected."Image: M&amp;G
