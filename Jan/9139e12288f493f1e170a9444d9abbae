Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, supported by the South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA), on Wednesday, officiated a send-off of young people to be placed in international cruise liners across the world.A special ceremony to send-off the youths from Alfred Nzo and O.R. Tambo District Municipalities, as well as Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, was held in Port St John, following the Premier s recent launch of the Maritime Youth Development Programme. This programme provides us with an opportunity to be active global citizens, participating in all the facets of life that are taking place in the global society, said Masualle.Out of 130 youths that were trained, 97 have qualified to be placed in the international cruise liners. These young people have been trained in first aid, crowd management, personal safety, swimming, and basic competence for being seamen and women. By placing them, the Programme seeks to empower young people to become more involved in the hospitality industry and steer the Province towards being a leader in the ocean economy in the country. The exciting thing is that these are permanent jobs, they provide Dollar earning and have international travelling opportunities, said SAMSA acting CEO Sobantu Tilayi. We decided to partner with the Eastern Cape because it has a vibrant Operation Phakisa Eastern Cape Programme. The Eastern Cape has the longest coastline in the country with ever-improving port infrastructure, aimed at boosting the National and Provincial GDP.
