Police in Port Elizabeth are investigating how a 52-year-old woman was shot and killed in Lukwe Street, Kwazakele, shortly after she came out of her house at 06:05 on Wednesday morning to go to work. "The victim, Ntombizonke Patricia Dywili, was shot several times at close range and passed away on the scene. "Police strongly suspect she was murdered due to possibly being a witness in another hit murder that took place a few days ago in the same street at a house opposite to her's," described police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "None of her personal belongings were taken, thus robbery as motive has been ruled out." Captain Beetge said that the woman could have been murdered after having witnessed another murder that happened on Saturday, 12 August 2017, at 18:30, at a house in Lukwe street - directly opposite from where she was murdered. "The victim in that murder, Makhaya Witness Mdoko, 43-years-old, was shot through his front door," he described. "The door was then forced open and the victim shot again. He died from several head and chest wounds." Captain Manatha said that the murder comes just after police arrested a 22-year-old male suspect early on Wednesday morning, at 02:00, in Zwide, for another hit that took place on 5 August 2017 in Nijomo Street, Soweto-on-Sea. "In this case, the bodies of a male and female that were shot several times were found in a house at 06:15," he described. "The victims, a 22-year-old male, Sithembiso Salaze, and a 17-year-old girl, Sinesipho Zondani, were murdered in what police suspects to be a revenge attack in a drug feud." On the arrest of the 22-year-old suspect on Wednesday morning, the Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, said that "murder stays the worst crime to be committed to any human being, and we as SAPS are dedicated to investigate, arrest and bring suspected murderers to court to face the maximum sentences by our Courts."
