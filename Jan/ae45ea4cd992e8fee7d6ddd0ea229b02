The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape says it is concerned that the principles of good governance such as transparency, upholding the law and accountability in terms of NPO s rights are not being upheld in the province."I will be writing to the Eastern Cape MEC for Social Development, Nancy Sihlwayi, to enquire about her plans to address the department's lack of capacity to follow internal funding processes efficiently," said Kobus Botha (MPL), the DA's Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Social Development. "MEC Sihlwayi and her top management officials were summoned to a special portfolio committee meeting that was held yesterday at the legislature precinct in Bhisho."This emerged after I exposed the cause and effect of the Department of Social Development s (DSD) unprofessional conduct towards non-profit organisations (NPOs) that render important statutory services such as placing vulnerable children in private places of safety, foster-care and psycho-social support services on behalf of the department to various clients in the Eastern Cape province."Botha said that the multi-party committee demanded answers with regards to several well established NPOs subsidy reductions in mainly East London and Nelson Mandela Bay that have received unannounced subsidy reductions by as much as 50% compared to last year s allocations."During the session, one official informed the provincial legislature portfolio committee that strife between MEC Sihlwayi and former Superintendent-General, Stanley Khanyile, was allegedly the reason behind various NPOs not receiving timeous and adequate information on subsidy cuts for the approved 2017/18 financial year NPO master list," he said."Acting head of the department, Ntombi Baart, also agreed that officials failed to follow all the policy steps as outlined in the Policy on Financial Awards (PFA)."Baart then concluded that consultative sessions will be arranged firstly with the individual organisations where proposals for supplementing their allocations with unallocated available funding amounting to R 6.7 million will be discussed."Eastern Cape residents deserve a government that cares and places high value on their needs. The DA will not give up the fight for good governance in our province.
