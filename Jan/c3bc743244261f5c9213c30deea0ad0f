Final year students at the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) Journalism Department hosted their annual public documentary screening at the Lilitha Nursing Hall, in East London.The annual documentary screening, which took place on Friday evening, aims to give final year students the exposure and opportunity to showcase their work and advance themselves with experience in the South African film industry.For the showcase, the students were put into four different groups and brainstormed amongst themselves to come up with a viable idea and later start researching.Traditionally, each year, the students have to pitch ideas to a panel of judges from a local organisation and a media practitioner while still in their second year. Additionally, when the students make it to their third year, they only have four months to research, script and shoot the documentaries.However, because of the 2015 fees must fall protests, as well as other challenges that the department faced, they couldn t go through the process of story idea pitching. The Students were grouped into four different groups and brainstormed amongst themselves and each group to come up with a viable idea and later start researching, WSU Journalism student, Abongile Jantjies, told RNEWS at the screening.Walter Sisulu University lecturer, Quadro Mgogo, said that he had been impressed by the amazing work done by the students as they only had four weeks to produce the documentaries. I came to WSU in February and the students had no background in video production because of a shortage of staff. I had to take then through video production programme to give them basic knowledge, said Mgogo.He added that, even though they were faced with challenges such as limited resources and a shortage of facilities, they managed to pull through and produced the documentaries independently. I m so inspired, I hope they can continue to produce documentaries and build their careers. I urge them to use this opportunity as the beginning of their careers in the field of journalism, said MgogoMark Fredericks, WSU Journalism Department lecturer, echoed him and said that they had insufficient time, but they managed to pull through. The class of 2017 got the best education as they learnt to rely on themselves, said Fredericks.He added that it takes hard work and dedication to change the world and that journalists are expected to change the world - the class of 2017 with their dedication, will change the world!Lubabalo Mashiqane, 21, the Director of Contradictions, which gor the award for Best Director, said that it was a very tough experience for them with insufficient resources and time. It was a very challenging yet positive experience given the circumstances; I take this opportunity as the beginning of my career, it is going to open many door for us, said Mashiqane.
