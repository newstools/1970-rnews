A 49-year-old Port Elizabeth woman, who on Sunday reported to police in Motherwell that her 3-month-old baby was abducted by three men in a black BMW in NU7, Motherwell, is expected in court on Thursday after it turned out that she lied."After three days of intensive investigation by the specialist investigating officers of the Motherwell SAPS Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS Unit), a breakthrough was made on Wednesday morning, after discovering that the case that was reported was in fact false," explained police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge."The real biological mother, 22 years old, of the 3-month-old baby was identified and questioned."It was discovered that there existed a foster parent arrangement between the two ladies without following the legal prescribed routes. This arrangement went sour and the false case was opened by the 49-year-old lady."The 49-year-old suspect was arrested and will be appearing before the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Friday on a charge of Perjury.The Department of Social Work Services will also be tasked to intervene and deal with this matter.
