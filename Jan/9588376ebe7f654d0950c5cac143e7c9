The Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University is phasing out the National Diploma in engineering programmes, to introduce new three-year Bachelor of Engineering Technology degrees.This year is the last year that the University had an intake of National Diploma programmes in Civil, Electrical, Industrial and Mechanical engineering, which will all be replaced with the BEngTech programmes.The new degree programmes were endorsed by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA), approved by the Council for Higher Education (CHE) and registered by the South African Quality Authority (SAQA).These outcomes based degrees are aligned to the new Higher Education Qualifications Sub-Framework (HEQSF) promulgated by the Minister of Higher Education in 2013.A degree in Marine Engineering will be offered once registration with SAQA is finalised.NMMU Faculty of Engineering, the Built Environment and Information Technology (EBEIT) executive dean Dr Oswald Franks said the new degree programmes would give students optimum opportunities for academic progression to doctorate level through the Honours and Masters (MEng) degrees. MTech and DTech degrees have already been phased out. The new degrees will replace the current National Diploma and with effect from January 2018 there will be no further first year registrations for the National Diploma, he said.The final intake and registration for BTech degrees will be in 2019. Rapidly developing science and technologies in the last decade requires a good understanding of Engineering Science to empower students to cope with fast developing technologies and innovation as well as to also ensure effective life-long learning abilities. This requires deeper conceptual understanding and a wider exposure to Mathematics and Basic Sciences, Dr Franks said. The new BEngTech degrees have been designed specifically to address these needs and will include a significant capstone practical project to integrate learning. The degrees will be offered on a full time basis. These BEngTech degrees are broad-based engineering qualifications that will ensure portability across a wide range of industries and services on a regional, national and international basis. These degrees will resort under the Sydney International Accord for international recognition of accredited Engineering Technology programmes.Graduates from these degrees will be able to gain status as professional Engineering Technologists or Technicians with ECSA, on successful completion of the candidacy phase requirements for industry work experience.For BEngTech graduates, a candidacy phase of four years applies for Professional Engineering Technologist and three years for Professional Engineering Technician.Further course information and access to online registration can be obtained at the following website: soe.nmmu.ac.za/Bachelor-of-Engineering-Technology.NMMU has offered ECSA accredited engineering programmes over many years and has well equipped laboratories as well as highly qualified and experienced academics and technical staff.
