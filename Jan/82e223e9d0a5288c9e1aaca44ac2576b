The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Tuesday recognised the City's top 50 companies at an awards ceremony held at the Boardwalk Convention Centre.Companies based in the Metro from all sectors were recognised for their role in developing the economy, creating jobs and promoting investment.This initiative forms part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Trade and Investment Strategy to retain and recognise investors, past and present.Speaking at the awards, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, said that the recent credit rating downgrades - otherwise called 'junk status' , should not affect the Eastern Cape if the private and public sector work hand in hand to grow the local economy. We can compete with national cities for investment because in this country, there are different investment ratings for regions, he added.Trollip said that through an Export Helpdesk, the Metro is working to improve and diversify its service offering."This objective is imperative in order to develop lasting and productive relationships with companies. The Metro is well positioned as an international investment destination of choice and should thus capitalise on its niche offerings," he added."We are a major role player in agriculture and ocean economy, as well as other key economic areas. We therefore need to capitalise on our strengths and develop the economy of our city to become competitive with others such as Cape Town."He said that the government s core goal of eradicating poverty, unemployment and equality is enabled through the continued investment by the business sector in the City."As such, the businesses' continued contribution to our City is acknowledged, highly appreciated and celebrated," the Mayor said."In recent years, some of the Nelson Mandela Bay s local companies, big and small, have shown confidence in doing business in the region. This has translated to new investments in the manufacturing industry and considerable expansions or re-investments have occurred or announced."Considering the plethora of challenges local companies have been and are currently faced with, many continue to grow in spite of strenuous increases in the cost of doing business locally and trading in a globally competitive market."Click HEREfor the full list of the companies that were recognised at the 2017 Nelson Mandela Bay Top 50 Companies Awards ceremony.
