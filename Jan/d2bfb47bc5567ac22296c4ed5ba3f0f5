Over 245 pairs of school shoes will be donated to the Coega Primary School in Wells EstateThe King 1V report on corporate governance requires organisations to be good corporate citizens, as they are the integral part of the broader society in which it operates. Therefore, the Coega Development Corporation (CDC) and leading Chinese automotive manufacturer First Automotive Works (FAW) SA, a R600-million assembly plant in Zone 2 of the Coega SEZ, will be donating the much needed pairs of school shoes to 245 school children from the Coega Primary School, situated at Wells Estate in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro.The handover of the 245 pairs of school shoes will take place at the Coega Primary School on Friday, 28 July 2017 at 10am. The handover ceremony will also be attended by the Department of Education in the District, which assisted FAW and CDC in identifying a beneficiary of the school shoes. The good deed by FAW and CDC is a continuation of previous corporate social responsibility projects, where 6 schools in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro have benefited, says Dr Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC s unit head of marketing &amp; communications.Over R200 000 worth of school supplies have been given to the Nelson Mandela Bay schools over the past 3 years, benefiting in particular schools located in Motherwell and Wells Estate areas, which are adjacent to both FAW and CDC. The beneficiaries include, Fumisikoma Primary, Melisizwe Primary, Imbasa Primary, Empumalanga Primary, Mdengentonga Primary and Coega Primary Schools.As good corporate citizens, we certainly hope that we can continue demonstrating Nelson Mandela s care for children and communities in dire need of our assistance. What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead. Nelson Mandela.
