The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Wednesday made an urgent appeal to pensioned residents and residents with disabilities, who are municipal account holders to re-apply for rebates on their property rates for the 2017/18 financial year, which began on 1 July 2017."Note that these property rebates do not include water and electricity: they are strictly limited to property only," said Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Communications Officer, Mthubanzi Mniki."Nelson Mandela Bay prides itself on being a caring city. This discount is only one of many ways in which the Municipality tries to assist those that are less fortunate."The NMBM Portfolio Chairperson of Budget &amp; Treasury, Cllr Retief Odendaal, said that the Municipality is committed to ensuring not only that the city's coffers are managed transparently and efficiently, but also to assist and provide relief to those in need.To qualify for the rebates, the applicant must:"The Municipality will not grant property rates rebates to residents who are recipients of the NMBM Indigent Subsidy , as they are completely exempt from paying any rates (the Municipality offers such recipients a 100% write-off on municipal accounts, based on their lack of financial means)," said Mniki."Residents, who have outstanding balances and would like to apply for the rebate, should either pay their account balances in full or at least have a payment arrangement with the Municipality in place before their applications will be considered. Such applicants need to continue paying, even after the rebate is granted, as the Municipality will not write off any existing debt."He said that applicants, who own more than one property will also not be considered for the said rebates; however, in exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the Municipality, a rebate may be granted."The application window opens in June of every year and the application process come into effect as from 1 July, the first day of the municipal financial year. Once a rebate is granted, it will be valid for one year only, and will not be amended on an ad hoc basis should the financial circumstances of the relevant household change during the year applied for. Residents, including existing recipients, need to re-apply for rebates every financial year," Mniki further said.To obtain application forms and more information, customers may visit their nearest municipal Customer Care Centre, call the Municipality's Customer Care number on 041 506 5555, the municipal website at www.mandelametro.gov.za
