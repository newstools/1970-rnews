The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) operator of the multi-award winning Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ), has been recognised for its dedication to job creation initiatives and excellent services to export orientated investors.The award bestowed onto the CDC, by the Exporters Club has been described by Dr Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC unit head Marketing &amp; Communications, as an achievement that demonstrates the organisations commitment to delivering world class services to investors and its broader client base. The CDC has been recognised consistently over the past three years for its contribution to job creation on various projects including having created over 7 243 operational jobs within the Coega SEZ at the end of the Financial Year 2016/17. We are certainly proud of this achievement, especially in the context of the numerous recognitions the CDC has received in this year alone, adds Dr Vilakazi.The CDC, in the current financial year 2017/18 has received no less than two (2) other awards, mainly Infrastructure Development winner at the Vision 2030 Awards and the Best International Trade Marketing Specialist - South Africa at the Sub-Saharan Enterprise Awards 2017.Recently the CDC announced that over four hundred and fifty two (452) much needed jobs have been created as a result of the booming construction in the SEZ.The projects currently at various phases of construction include the (1) Customs Control Area (CCA) 90 jobs, (2) BAIC Ring Road Project 4 jobs, (3) BAIC construction site (Automotive sector) 144 jobs, (4) MM Engineering (Energy Sector) 89 jobs, (5) Kenako Construction 76 jobs and (6) Osho Cement (Metals sector) 49 jobs. We are certainly mindful of the socio economic-environment in which we are operating under. Therefore, every job created is critical in putting food on the table of many of our citizens who rely on the opportunities provided by the Coega SEZ through these projects, concludes Dr Vilakazi.Image: RECOGNITION:the CDC recently won two award certificates, mainly the IDC Job creation, and Best Provider of Service to Exporters at the recently held Exporters awards in Port Elizabeth.
