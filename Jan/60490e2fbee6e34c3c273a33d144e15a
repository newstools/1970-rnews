The Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) Board Chairperson Phil Goduka on Thursday welcomed the confirmation by the Auditor General that the Agency had retained its clean audit status for the 2015/16 financial period, its fourth consecutive such audit result.On Wednesday, Auditor General Kimi Makwetu announced the audit outcomes of South Africa s 263 local municipalities and their entities for the financial period 2015 / 2016.The MBDA is one of ten institutions in Eastern Cape that attained a clean audit, being an unqualified audit with no material findings.Commenting on the outcomes, Goduka says The Board, management and staff welcomes the clean audit outcome and recognise that this affirmation is only possible through strong leadership, efficient systems and a supportive parent municipality."Strengthening the agency s operating systems and procedures is one of our key focus areas in future and to ensure that we continuously improve our efficiencies and delivery around our evolving mandate .He added that; The Board is resolute on making sure that the Agency has a clear mandate and strategic goals that support the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality s Integrated Development Plan (IDP). We also want to put in place a structure that has the leadership and capabilities to deliver on that mandate."To that end, the Board is continuing the search to recruit a suitable Chief Executive Officer with an advert that will feature in a number of national and local newspapers from Friday 23rd to Monday."
