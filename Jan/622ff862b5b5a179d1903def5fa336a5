Unrelenting efforts by SAPS to end the taxi violence incidents across the province paid off when Jeffreys Bay members nipped the looming taxi violence in the bud and arrested two male suspects, aged 26 and 45-years-old, on charges of attempted murder and assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. "Police acted swiftly after receiving a complaint of fighting at the taxi rank in Ocean View at about 08:30, on Tuesday morning," said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart . "It is alleged that two groups assaulted one another and shots were fired by community members. Police intervened and the groups were dispersed. No fatalities were reported, but three males were taken to hospital for medical attention."She said that the two suspects will appear in the Humansdorp Magistrate's Court soon on charges ranging from assault to attempted murder. "Police cannot rule out the possibility of more arrests as the investigations advance."The Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brig John Lebok condemned the members for nipping the taxi fighting in the bud. Police will not tolerate any fighting and violence at the taxi ranks. Taxi owners and drivers must find an amicable way to resolve their matters and break the cycle of violence, said Brig Lebok.
