The Enoch Mgijima Municipality has stopped what the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape called illegal accommodation payments that were due to be made to several African National Congress (ANC) councillors.According to Malibongwe Xhelisilo, a DA PR Councillor in the Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality, the DA alerted the Acting MM, Siyabonga Nkonki, through SMS, of the impending payment that the CFO wanted to make on behalf of ANC Councillors, who were due to attend an ANC Cadres Forum in Mdatsane on Sunday."According to the official record, the CFO granted the accommodation payment on the understanding that the said Councillors were due to write an exam the following day," he said."In an SMS to the Acting MM on Saturday night, I made him aware of the fact that the payment for 'writing exams' was actually to accommodate Councillors to attended a political event and that the Municipality cannot be liable for political events."Nkonki, has proven on more than a few occasions that he is not capable of managing the already financially troubled Enoch Mgijima Municipality. Those close to him continue to benefit unduly, including the illegally appointed Councillors who are still enjoying the full benefits of being fulltime Councillors even after correspondence from MEC Fikile Xasa on the illegality of those appointments."Xhelisilo said that in the Acting MM s reply to my SMS, he indicated that he would instruct the CFO to immediately cancel the booking."Indeed the booking was cancelled, saving our Municipality over R15 000. Money that can now be used for much-needed infrastructure and service delivery in our Municipality," he added."The DA is committed to stopping corruption in order for our Municipalities to function effectively. We will continue to fight for better municipalities, and more specifically, better management of municipal finances."
