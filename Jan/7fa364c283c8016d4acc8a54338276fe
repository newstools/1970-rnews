The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday said that it will lay a complaint with the Speaker of the Beaufort West Municipality, Ms. Euna Wentzel, against the municipality's former Mayor, who is now an African National Congress (ANC) Councillor, Truman Prince."This comes after a telephonic recording emerged of Cllr. Prince (who is the former ANC Mayor of Beaufort West) threatening the Beaufort West Municipal Manager, Mr. Roelof Van Staden with his life, swearing at him and making derogatory remarks about the newly-elected DA Mayor, Mr. Japie van der Linde . This demands a full investigation from Speaker Wentzel," described Daylin Mitchell MPP - DA Constituency Head: Beaufort West and Central Karoo Municipality .Mitchell said that according to the Municipal Code of Conduct for Councillors, a councillor must at all times act in the best interest of the municipality and in such a way that the credibility and integrity of the municipality are not compromised."The DA believes that with this telephonic conversation, Cllr. Prince appears to be guilty of serious misconduct and that he is not fit to represent the public. Under no circumstances is it acceptable to threaten a senior official in this way. It's the not the kind of behaviour that one would expect from a public office bearer," he said."We believe that the complaint should be forwarded to a municipal disciplinary committee. Cllr. Prince should be dealt with promptly."The people of Beaufort West have voted Truman Prince out of government, and have rejected the ANC. Truman Prince cannot rule from the grave through strong-arm tactics."
