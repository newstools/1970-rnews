The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Thursday afternoon said that vegetation fires across Nelson Mandela Bay have increased."In addition to the fires at Van Stadens Gorge,Greenbushes and Bushbuckridge areas that the Fire and Emergency team dealt and still dealing with since yesterday,more areas have been added," the municipality said."Teams have been despatched to extinguish fires at Rocklands(still trying to get the fire under control), Theescombe Welcome Avenue(under control for now), Victoria Drive (still trying to control) and Sardinia Bay Road (still trying to get the fire under control). "For now, only four informal dwellings have been destroyed at Van Stadens Gorge."No injuries have been reported so far."The increase of the wind speed is posing a challenge for the fire fighting teams, however they are doing their best to limit injury to people, animals and property to zero," the municipality said."As the day progresses wind speed is expected to decrease, according to SA Weather Services. This will make conditions a bit more concusive for fire fighters working on these areas."Residents are advised to report fires at (041) 585 1555.More updates to follow.
