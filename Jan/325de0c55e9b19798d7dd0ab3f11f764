As details emerge about how a female student at the Walter Sisulu University in East London lavishly spent R818 000 from a R14 million deposit that was erroneously loaded onto her meal and book allowance account, the university on Thursday confirmed that she will face criminal charges.According to Walter Sisulu University spokesperson, Yonela Tukwayo; "The Walter Sisulu University management met with the executives of IntelliMali on Wednesday."After preliminary investigations they confirmed that an amount of R14,1 million was erroneously processed to the student s IntelliCard in June 2017. They also confirmed that the student had spent R818,000 of this allowance."Tukwayo confirmed that the student, now identified as Sibongile Mani, has also had her IntelliCard blocked and the remaining balance has been retracted."IntelliMali indicated that they will lay criminal charges against the student for the misappropriation of funds. IntelliMali has taken responsibility for this loss and has absorbed this cost," she added."All other student allowances are unaffected and will be available in full for the remainder of the year."A forensic investigation has been initiated to determine the exact circumstances around this incident. The full transaction records of the student s spending spree are being scrutinised."Spending spree that was only stopped by rivalryReports have emerged of how Mani, who is a branch secretary of the Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania (PASMA) at the university, helped herself to the R14 million by buying expensive weaves, throwing lavish parties for her friends, whom she also showered with expensive gifts such as iPhones.
