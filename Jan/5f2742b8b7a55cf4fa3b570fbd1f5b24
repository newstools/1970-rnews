In celebration of Womens Month in August, the next Financial Mail Private Lounge business breakfast presented in association with Nu Skin, will focus on the importance of stimulating an entrepreneurial culture, particularly amongst women, through direct marketing opportunities. The event takes place at Emperors Palace on Saturday, 5 August, and aims to inform and motivate the broader business community in South Africa about narrowing the gender gap between male and female entrepreneurial undertakings. The GDP has grown at only 0.2% since April 2017, and unemployment is currently at 26.5%. With the junk status rating, the need to foster a spirit of entrepreneurship in South Africa has never been more desperate. Increasingly the focus on the importance of female entrepreneurship in the country can t be ignored, says event organiser Taryn Westoby, Head of Tiso Blackstar Group Events.Against this backdrop Nu Skin, as a direct selling company, offers a much needed solution for many South Africans where the positive impact of their business has opened many entrepreneurial doors. Marise Groenewald, Marketing and Operations Manager at Nu Skin South Africa says, the direct sales industry 2016 results show that 72% of the entrepreneurs involved are females, which equates to over 340 000 women being empowered in South Africa. There is no disparity from an earnings potential between male and female entrepreneurs, and women are among the top earners in Nu Skin locally and globally, says Groenewald. Groenewald highlights that a company like Nu Skin, which has no barriers to entry both from a financial or qualifications perspective, allows individuals to start their own business as soon as they turn 18. No other industry can offer this, she says.For more information, please contact Melissa de Agrela at deAgrelaM@tisoblackstar.co.za
