In the 16 months since the Fort Grey TB Hospital in East London was closed in March 2016, this building has been reduced to a heap of rubble, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape said on Thursday."The DA is horrified to witness this despicable act of vandalism, the horrific waste of resources and infrastructure and the loss of a facility capable of housing 162 beds that could have been re-purposed," said Celeste Barker MPL, the DA's Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Health. "In a forward thinking, well-run province, the challenges in society should be addressed proactively and with long-term planning that leaves a legacy for generations to come. This includes the maintenance of infrastructure to ensure delivery of services."Barker said that she has submitted legislature questions to the Eastern Cape MEC for Health, Dr Phumza Dyantyi, to clarify why this important resource was allowed to fall into such a state of disrepair:1. Which official from which Department signed the rental agreement for the old Fort Grey Hospital? 2. What were the terms of the lease? 3. How long was the official lease? Please provide a full copy of the lease agreement. 4. Who owned the buildings of the Fort Grey TB Hospital at the time of its closure? 5. Please name the body or individuals responsible for security on the premises of the Fort Grey Hospital after the conclusion of its final lease agreement."In a province where every cent is needed, we must ensure that our state resources are used in a sustainable manner," she added.
