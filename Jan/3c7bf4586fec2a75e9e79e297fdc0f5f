Efforts by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to seek a dissolution of Parliament may have been dealt a setback after the party's close ally in the National Assembly and in several municipalities, the United Democratic Movement (UDM) announced on Thursday that it is against such a move.The DA on Wednesday said that it bring the motion to dissolve Parliament to the National Assembly on Thursday and request that it be debated as soon as possiblefor parliament to be dissolved and an early national election held. This is after the DA-sponsored motion of no-confidence in President Jacob Zuma was defeated - by a slight margin, on Tuesday. "The UDM does not support the Democratic Alliance (DA) sponsored motion for the dissolution of the National Assembly. We respect the DA s right to propose motions like any other political party represented in the National Assembly," said UDM leader, Bantu Holomisa, in a brief statement."Of immediate importance to the UDM, is the state of readiness of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for the 2019 National and Provincial Elections."He said that the IEC reportedly needs R300 million, as well as access to municipalities databases to capture voters addresses before the Constitutional Court deadline of June next year. "The IEC must move with speed to ensure that the voters roll is cleaned and that correct addresses of the electorate are factored in. "To this end, we call on Government to ensure that the IEC is provided with the money they need to comply with the ruling," Holomisa said."The mandate of the current Government comes to an end in 2019, and we are working towards that end. We want to make sure that the 2019 Elections are credible, free and fair."
