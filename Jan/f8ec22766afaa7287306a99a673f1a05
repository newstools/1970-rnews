The Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality Council on Tuesday announced the appointment of Andile Sihlahla as the Metro's new Municipal Manager.He replaces, former MM, Andile Fani, whom the South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Eastern Cape insists was dismissed because he stood in the way of a corrupt cartel operating at the municipality with the goal of looting state resources. Addressing the media at the Mayor's Boardroom, City Hall, in East London, Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality Executive Mayor, Xola Pakati, said that it is very significant in the Metro for Sihlahla s arrival for he is son of the Eastern Cape, born in Queenstown, where he did his early schooling. Sihlahla holds two distinct qualifications from the University of Fort Hare, where he graduated with Bjuris and LLB degrees, said Pakati.He added that he has broad experience in directing properties, estates, legal advice and admistration at Gauteng s Ekurhuleni Metro between 2010 and 2014.Pakati said that having Sihlahla in the Metro is a great privilege as he had worked with local government and also being the Municipal Manager of the Great Kei Municipality between 2007 and 2009.Sihlahla has also sat in various Boards including the Eastern Cape Development Corporation (ECDC), and also in society, he served in various student and workers leadership positions as part of his contribution to the broader mass movement. We are indeed privilege to have the man of his calibre and we are looking forward to his productive relationship that will enhance the delivery of services to our people, said Pakati.Addressing journalists, Sihlahla said that he is looking forward in working with the BCM team to grow the Municipality. I know Metro has already has its own vision, I need to sit down with my need to sit down with my colleagues and discuss future plans of how we can grow and take metro forward, said Sihlahla.He added that, he ll work together with BCM team to accelerate growth and development in the Metro.
