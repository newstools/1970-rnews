A 60-year-old man from London, in the United Kingdom, passed away in a Plettenberg Bay hospital on Friday after being rescued from rip currents. According to Marc Rodgers, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Plettenberg Bay station commander, "At 09h41, the NSRI Plettenberg Bay duty crew were activated following reports of a drowning in progress at Solar Beach, Robberg." Rodgers said that the sea rescue craft, Ray Farnham and Airlink Rescuer, were launched and the NSRI rescue vehicle with NSRI rescue swimmers and NSRI medics responded directly to the scene. "The SA Police Services, Med-Life ambulance services and an NSRI doctor responded. "The man, 60-year-old from London in the United Kingdom, had been rescued from the water by two bystanders and by an off-duty lifeguard who had swum out to assist after witnessing the man being swept out to sea by rip currents while swimming," he described. Rodgers said that on reaching the beach they raised the alarm and a doctor who happened to be on the beach at the time commenced CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) efforts that were joined by NSRI medics on their arrival shortly after CPR had commenced. "CPR efforts were joined by paramedics and by the NSRI doctor on the beach. "The man was transported to hospital by ambulance with CPR efforts continuing and doctors and nurses continued with CPR efforts in hospital but sadly after all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted he was declared deceased by doctors," he described. "The British Consulate are assisting family abroad and the man was travelling alone in South Africa. "Sincerest Condolences are conveyed to family and friends."
