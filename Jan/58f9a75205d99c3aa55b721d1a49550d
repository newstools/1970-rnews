The Buffalo City Metro (BCM) on Monday urged motorists to be patient and explore alternative routes as the City is currently intensifying roadworks in Fleet Street and other areas of the City.According to BCM Communication Manager, Samkelo Ngwenya, the Metro is currently working on the Fleet Street project, which started a few years ago with a plan to divide the works in five phases. These are - Pontoon Road to Oxford Street, Oxford to Station Streets, Station Street to Ganteaume Crescent, Ganteaume Crescent to Currie Street and Currie to Fitzpatrick Road, said Ngwenya.He added that the city has currently completed the following areas - Currie Street to Fitzpatrick Road, Currie Street to Ganteaume Crescent and Ganteaume Crescent to Station Street.While 90 percent of the Southern parts of Station Street, which is currently closed, have been finished, work started this week on the Northern side of Cambridge Street. For those using the road to town or the Quigney area, they can use Caxton Street as an alternative route as roadworks will also commence between Station Street and the bottom of Oxford Street," said Ngwenya.He further added that, the project also includes the relocation of sewer lines, water pipes, and electrical services while reconstructing Fleet Street. Other roads to be closed in the next weeks include Drury Lane near KFC downtown and the Metro has set aside R128 million on the Fleet Street upgrade, concluded Ngwenya.
