The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Tuesday said that it is currently experiencing very low levels in the bulk storage reservoirs on the western side of the Metro."The fires that occurred between Van Stadens and Loerie have damaged the electrical supply to the Loerie Water Treatment Works and various pump stations in the area," the municipality explained."This has resulted in a complete loss of supply from the Loerie system as well as an inability to transfer water from other systems due to large pump stations being down.Indications are that electrical supply will only be re-established by Wednesday night." As a result the NMBM is currently running out of water at a number of its reservoirs.The areas that will be affected first: Rowallan Park, Kabega, Westering, Cotsworld, Sunridge Park, Framesby, Fernglen, Linton Grange, Gelvendale, Baywest Area, KwaNobuhle, Reservoir Hills, Khayamnandi, Van Stadens Gorge area, and all consumers connected to the Loerie Summit - Chelsea Bulk Supply pipeline."Residents/Businesses in these areas could already be experiencing low water pressure and discoloured water as a result of the critically low levels in the supplying reservoirs. Water should be used for essential purposes ONLY," the municipality said."The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality requests citizens to jointly assist in drastically cutting water consumption in order to avoid a water shortage disaster. If this situation does not improve, it will result in further areas being affected, more water disruptions and lower water pressure in other areas."Water restrictions will remain in play. Please do not fill any tanks - this will just increase the demand."
