The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Monday officially opened the Gqebera Public Library, in Walmer, Port Elizabeth. There are now twenty-six public libraries in the Nelson Mandela Bay.The Gqebera Public Library caters for early, Easy, Medium, Junior, and Early teenage readers, offering the services of lending of books, magazines, CDs, DVDs, story times, information sources (journals), magazines &amp; audio books).For many years, the people of Walmer used the Walmer Town library that is located approximately a kilometre away.Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, who delivered the keynote speech at the launch said that he hoped the library will assist in creating a culture of reading among kids and adults. Parents have a big role to play, in educating their children about the importance of reading," he said.Trollip also told the learners, who gathered to witness the opening of the library, to learn to do proper research and not rely on Googling everything as some information online might be incorrect. Don t accept everything you read on Google, the Library is the best way to build your knowledge," he said."That is why the municipality has provided a library to your community for your children to build their knowledge. A library is not a place to play, but a place to learn, books can take you away from Walmer and find yourself somewhere beautiful by just reading it. Also, speaking at the event, Executive Director for Sport, Recreation, Arts, and Culture, Noxolo Nqwazi, said that, the library has computers, book, daily newspapers and so on, so it caters for everyone - not only the school children. For example, you can come to the library to do your CV, use the daily newspapers to search for possible employment. Nqwazi urged the community to look after their new library.Mayor Trollip agreed; I m convinced that this community will look after this library and they understand how important it is for the child to broaden their horizons through learning and acquiring knowledge. So, I was counting on the parents and the teachers to encourage the children to make use of this wonderful experience, right here in Walmer.
