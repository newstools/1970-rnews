Caltex Eastern Cape Marketer (CECM) re-opened George Motors, a multi-million rand investment service station, situated at the corner of Struanway and Daku Road in Kwazakhele on Wednesday morning.With 102 service stations in the Eastern Cape, including 34 in disadvantaged areas, CECM has invested more than R300-million into the province and its people.The grand re-opening of the new George Motors site renders an investment of R15-million, and in the western half of South Africa, it is Caltex s biggest single investment.The re-open of the new site comes after the former leased site, now a ruin across the road, expired a few years ago, and was not set up for renewal. This journey started precisely 39 months ago, when the old site became out-leased, and without an option to renew, we looked at this open land [across the road], where we found an opening to start proceedings for a new service station. To me, this garage standing here is one big miracle, addressed CECM Retailer, Andre Rademan, at the George Motors re-opening.Rademan, who is also the Eastern Province Rugby Union President who succeeded the controversial Cheeky Watson, says that he was homed at the previous site for 17 years, before having to vacate in November 2016. I did not know how I would react leaving the old site, but now when I look at it from this new site, I feel like this is my new home, he said. The community needed something like this in the vicinity, and we are here to provide a service to the community, whether in the forecourt or in the shop, to make this a better place for the community around us. Construction of the new service station started in January 2017, and part of their refurbishment was the much improved road works around the plot, in order to better facilitate accessibility from residents in the area. In terms of our corporate theme in better serving our community as well, we put environmental-friendly tanks in here with LED lights, and we will continue with aspects to expand and improve our theme to serve the community, CEO of CECM, Clive Berlyn, addressed. On the western half, we [CECM] guardian 42 sites of the province s 102, so this is a significant investment, one that we can certainly be proud of, Berlyn added.FreshStop Operations Director, Dave Hogg, also took a moment to commend and thank CECM for consistently branding FreshStop with Caltex service stations around the province. To the shareholders and executives of CECM, thank you for your belief in the FreshStop brand and that bears testimony that we [FreshStop] are on 30 of your sites around the province, and we are proud to be in this association, commented Hogg.Following the speeches, both Caltex and FreshStop partook in a ribbon-cutting ceremony to inaugurate the service station s official opening to public. A plaque was also unveiled to pronounce this opening.Image:The Caltex George Motors in Kwazakhele.Watch to see proceedings at the George Motors grand re-openiing on Thursday morning
