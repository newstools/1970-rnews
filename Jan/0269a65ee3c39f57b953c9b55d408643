While the cold front that began lashing Cape Town on Tuesday night is expected to dump most of its rain in the Western Cape on Wednesday, the Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service has warned the Eastern Cape to brace itself for gale force winds of up to 100km/h.According to Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Services; "This system is expected to bring very strong interior winds on Wednesday (7 June) possibly reaching gale force in places in the western and northern interior. " By the early hours of Thursday morning we might see some light snow on the Sneeuberg (Graaff-Reinet) through to the southern Drakensberg (Barkley East/Elliot area)."Sampson added; "Please note that while some showers are expected along the south coast, most of the rain will impact on the Western Cape and not much can be expected over the Eastern Cape. This system is therefore significant due to the strong winds that many areas will experience and a sudden drop in temperatures on Thursday and Friday." Advisories: 1. Wednesday and Thursday: Strong NW'ly winds are expected over the interior on Wednesday and Thursday, possibly reaching gale force over the western and northern interior on Wednesday. Gale force W'ly winds are expected along the south coast on Thursday, spreading toward East London.2. Thursday: High seas with wave heights from 6 to 9m are expected along the south coast on Thursday.
