By Monday, at the latest, all communities or suburbs listed in the tables below should have had all backlog waste collected, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, announced on Sunday."These are areas in which black refuse bags are used for waste disposal."All other areas not listed will be dealt with in the approaching week as these communities mostly use wheelie bins," he described."We have had to work around the fact that Municipal wheelie bin compactor truck drivers are also striking."Nonetheless, we hope to have these additional trucks on the road by Wednesday at the latest once we have contracted stand-in Code 14 drivers through the Department of Labour."The Mayor said that in the interim, the municipality is increasing capacity in its Litter Picking Programmes across the City to collect and dispose of loose litter and waste."The clean up operation is running to schedule. I am confident that we are creating sufficient interim support capacity to deal with the effects of the strike," he described."Thank you for understanding the need for this government to hold the line with departments so that we can bring an end to financial irregularities, while improving system efficiencies."Please continue to use the waste management hotline for all queries/complaints - 041 506 7405. The dust will settle. We are moving forward."
