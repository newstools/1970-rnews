Port Elizabeth police are investigating a case of public violence after another truck was burnt in Motherwell on Tuesday.According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the truck was burnt in Motherwell NU1, next to the Boxer shopping center. Police are yet to confirm, but suspect the incident is connected to the recent protests by local residents, who took to the streets last week Thursday after apparently being served eviction notices by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality after illegaly occupying municipal land. At this point, we are not sure if the same protesters are the responsible for this incident, but a docket of public violence has been opened, Captain Beetge told RNEWS.During the protests, the residents from Wells Estate, Ikamvelihle, Ward 54 Motherwell, burnt and damged several vehicles. At one point they also blocked off the a section of the N2 Highway and on Monday blocked off the R337 and burnt a bakkie and a bus.
