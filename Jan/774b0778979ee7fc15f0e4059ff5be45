Vehicles were torched and damaged by protesting Port Elizabeth residents on Monday morning. The residents, who took to the streets at 5:00am are unhappy about the eviction notices they received last week to vacate the land that they apparently illegally occupied.Last week, the same protesters burned down a truck and closed off a section of the N2 highway and fought running battles with the police.A truck and a bus were burned to the ground by protesters while the R334 road, from Port Elizabeth to Uitenhage, was blocked with burning tyres and rubble - forcing drivers to seek alternative routes.Public Order Police officers later arrived on the scene and were monitoring the situation.Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said that they have managed to control the situation. The R334, road leading to Uitenhage was affected, but we managed to control the situation and disperse the crowd, but people cannot use this road yet for their safety, he told RNEWS.No one was injured or arrested and the police are still present in the area.
