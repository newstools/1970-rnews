In an effort to provide efficient and responsive policing in the Uitenhage Cluster, various operations were conducted over the past weekend, which yielded good results and led to the arrest of 126 suspects."The suspects were arrested for crimes ranging from robbery, rape, murder, attempted murder, possession of drugs, possession of suspected stolen property, drunken driving, burglary, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm and theft," said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "A total of 35 traffic fines were issued, valued at more than R17 500."Captain Swart said that the SAPS also wants to encourage the community to work with the SAPS in reducing crime and they appeal to the community to provide valuable information that will lead to the arrest of suspects involved in the hijacking of motor vehicles, house robberies and business robberies (commonly referred to by the SAPS as trio crimes) which will ultimately lead to the conviction of these criminals."Let us share information and support each other in the fight against crime.
