In an effort to help the community of Bethelsdorp, in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth, fight crime, local businesses have come on board with financial assistance to the suburb's Community Policing Forum (CPF)."This gesture followed after police were busy following up on the trail of a suspect during a tracing operation within the area of Bethelsdorp," described police spokesperson, Captain Sandra Janse Van Rensburg."One of the police officers and other members noticed that the patrollers were doing a good job helping to fight crime by doing patrols in the area, even though they lacked the essential tools for the job."This lack of necessary resources hampered their work in many ways."Captain Van Rensburg said that poor lighting in the area and the absence of identification for the patrollers, communication tools etc., the area's Detective Commander worked hand in hand with the CPF at the station and identified needs such as reflective jackets, torches, whistles, lanyards and caps."Without any hesitation, there was an overwhelming response from various businesses, who came to the assistance of the patrollers," she added.On Thursday, these items were handed over to the Bethelsdorp patrollers to ensure that they are easily identifiable within their community by the SAPS and local community members."Bethelsdorp SAPS would like to express sincere gratitude and appreciation to the sponsors who opened their hearts to support this initiative," said Cpt Van Rensburg."The SAPS would also like emphasise the importance of getting the community to work with the CPF and the police."Mount Road Cluster Commander, Maj Gen Funeka Siganga, said; Together we can ensure that community member s feel safe at all times.
