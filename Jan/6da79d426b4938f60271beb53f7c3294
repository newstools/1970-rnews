The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality held a first of its kind meeting with the Nelson Mandela Bay legal fraternity to create a relationship and brief the legal fraternity about the operations of the municipal legal operations. The meeting followed an outcry by the Black Lawyers Association in the Bay that their members were being sidelined as the Mtero often always hires 'white' legal firms to represent it. The meeting was also meant to allow the Nelson Mandela Bay legal minds an opportunity to interact and advise the municipality on how to improve the municipal legal services and build a relationship that will benefit the citizens of the city. Spe aking at the meeting, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Deputy Executive Mayor said: "We want you to advise us on how best we can improve our legal services and the relationship with the legal fraternity. This meeting is historic, we will only build from this solid now". The Deputy Executive Mayor is the politician responsible for oversight of the municipal legal services.
