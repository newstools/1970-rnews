Five males, aged 19 to 30, were arrested during these incidents and will be charged for Public Violence."Captain Beetge said that two petrol bombs and a further 25 tyres were confiscated during the day in the area after attempts were made by protestors to start burning barricades on the R335 (Addo Road) passing Wells Estate."At 15:30, a bus belonging to Algoa Bus was damaged after it was thrown with stones in Jijana Street in Wells Estate. School children were passengers, but fortunately nobody was injured in the incident," he added."Two rear windows were shattered and a petrol bomb which fell inside the bus without igniting, will be anylised by forensics experts."The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, has expressed his shock that school children traveling in a bus were targeted with stones and petrol bombs."I view this incident as extremely serious.

We appeal to our community structures to intervene as well to stop this violence," he said.
