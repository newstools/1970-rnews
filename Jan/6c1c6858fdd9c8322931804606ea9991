The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Monday said that it will clear any outstanding waste collection backlog in Motherwell and Wells Estate by the end of this week.After a deal was struck in June with the South African Municipal Workers' Union (SAMWU) to end the go slow by Nelson Mandela Municipality refuse collection staff, several parts of the Bay still remained with many piles of uncollected rubbish."Municipal waste management teams are currently delivering services to all parts of these communities," described Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip."In recent weeks, isolated acts of criminality have put the lives of municipal staff at risk preventing the full delivery of services."The Municipality is pleased to announce that from today the regular refuse collection schedule is being followed and all residents should take bags and bins out on the scheduled days of service." He said that delivering services to all residents is crucial in a well-run city, but this can only happen if municipal staff and vehicles are not subject to violence or intimidation."Residents are urged to work alongside this government as it takes Nelson Mandela Bay forward."
