The Buffalo City Municipality (BCM) on Wednesday afternoon handed over Grant-In-Aid funding to 134 local Non Profit Organisations (NGO) as assistance in their community development efforts across the City at the City Hall, East London.According to the Buffalo City Municipality , a total of R1.4 million was set aside for the selected organisations that are responsibile for child and youth centres, HIV/Aids centres, social and welfare organisations, home-based centres, early childhood development centres, arts and culture organisations, disabled and old age centres, support groups, alcohol and drug centres.Speaking at the handover ceremony, Buffalo City Municipality Executive Mayor, Xola Pakati, said that the municipality was urging all the beneficiaries to use the funds for what they were intended for. We do recognise the good job done by the NGO S despite being faced by great financial challenges, so it is important for us municipality to assist them, said Executive Mayor Pakati.He added that poverty is still a great challenge in developing the country, and that government has limited resources, but needs to assist at all times to those in need. Today, we gathered here to pledge support to these NGO s coming from disadvantaged community and promise to always assist where help is needed, said Executive Mayor Pakati.The budget has been spread geographically in the following areas of Buffalo City Municipality, Coastal East London; Midland Mdantsane; Inland - King Williams Town.Executive Mayor Pakati visited one of the beneficiaries of the Grants-In-Aid fund - the Little Kids Cr che in Duncan Village, East London.The cr che was established in 2012 catering for 60 children from infancy to five-years-old around Duncan Village.Speaking to RNEWS, founder of Little Kids cr che, Liziwe Mthethwa, said that she was given a site by the community and she build the day-care centre with an aim to assist parents, who cannot afford to send children to the expensive day care centres. Ever since the cr che was opened, we still have challenges - we have no toilets, no running water and we don t cook for the children as we lack resources and equipment, desrribed Mthehwe.She added that she has been applying for funding and sponsors from the Municipality and private business, but with no success. The condition of the cr che is bad as a result when the weather is bad we have to send kids back home as the roof once collapsed, it is not safe and everyday its sleepless nights for me as I fear for the lives of the little kids, said Mthethwa.She said that, on the 8th of June 2017, the cr che collapsed and community rebuild it but now they had to cater for almost 40 in one room. Every day, we see the number of the children attending decrease, we hope by this donation we will be able to make a difference and kids come back to the centre, said Mthethwa.The municipality donated R10 000 to the Little Kids, and also promised to approach sponsors to donate toys and other facilities for the cr che. I am grateful to the Buffalo City Municipality; the money they gave us will make a huge difference and hopefully it will be enough to renovate the cr che, said Mthethwa.Speaking to RNEWS, Thandi Mqolo, said that she was grateful to Buffalo City Municipality for the donation they gave the Little Kids centre as they have no other affordable day care centres in the area where they can send their children. We are grateful to the Buffalo City Municipality , the condition of the cr che was depressing, we hoping to see difference and urge municipality to continue assisting where help is needed, added Mqolo.The Buffalo City Municipality will monitor the Grant-In-Aid fund beneficiaries and continue to visits the site to check if the grant is being used effectively and according to its purpose.
