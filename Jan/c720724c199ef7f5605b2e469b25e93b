The Constitutional Court is expected on Thursday to hand down judgement on the constitutionality of the use of a secret ballot in Parliament as opposition parties seek a no confidence vote against President Jacob Zuma.Opposition parties have argued that only a secret ballot will ensure that everyone - including disgruntled MPs in African National Congress (ANC), will be able to vote without the fear of reprisals from those, who are against the removal of Zuma.However, Zuma and National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete, are challenging the application, which was brought before the court by the United Democratic Movement s (UDM), saying the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, does not provide for a secret ballot in Parliament.The UDM's arguement relies on Section 102 (2) of the Constitution, which states that if the National Assembly by a vote supported by a majority of its members passes a motion of no confidence in the president the president and the other members of the Cabinet must resign.But the parties are arguing that if President Zuma was elected as president through a secret ballot, he can also be voted out of office the same way.Calls for President Zuma to resign over alleged corruption and bad leadership have increased recently following his abrupt firing of former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, and his Deputy , former Eastern Cape MEC for Economic Development, Mcebisi Jonas, leading to two credit rating downgrades. The actual debate on the motion of no confidence vote had to be postponed to allow for the court application to be finalised.
