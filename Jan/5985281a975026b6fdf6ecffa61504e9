If you are going on a business trip for several days, you do not always need to pack unique outfits for each day unless, you have a truly oversized suitcase that can carry seven suits, seven shirts, etc.Instead, the ideal business trip suitcase is filled with interchangeable items. That means, at most pack a jacket and a pair of trousers for every other day, rather than every day, and mix and match to create different effects.Of course, some items, socks and underwear particularly, should be packed in one-per-day amounts unless you have convenient access to a hotel laundry.Packing for a full week of business events in varying formality would look something like this:Other items will be dictated by necessity: electronics and papers you bring, any sporting clothes the specific trip requires, and so forth. If you fancy a hat, wear it on the plane to save room.
