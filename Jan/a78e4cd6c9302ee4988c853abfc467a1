Police Management in the Eastern Cape has expressed shock after the discovery of two partly decomposed bodies in bushes near NU 6 Mdantsane, in East London, on Thursday at around midday.The discovery was made while members of the K9 unit were searching for a suspect in a possible unrelated case."A young school girl reported an attempted attack on her by an unknown male in the vicinity where the bodies were later discovered," said police spokesperson, Capt Mluleki Mbi . "The search for this suspect has been called off due to nightfall and poor visibility. The two bodies that were discovered are apparently two young females."The circumstances surrounding their death are unknown and no positive identification has been possible at this stage. The matter is treated as a top priority and a full investigation is underway." The Provincial SAPS Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga emphasised that Police in the Province is determined to increase their strides in the reduction of crimes against women and children. We will do everything we possibly can to help make our women and children safe. I further call on parents and guardians to assist us and to be always aware of the whereabouts of children and teenagers," she said."A missing person must be reported as soon as possible. There must also be good communication between parents and children to ensure that strange or out of character behaviour is followed up. We need to stop this scourge of violence now. Each case of this nature will be investigated as a priority to ensure that perpetrators are arrested to face the full might of the law."
