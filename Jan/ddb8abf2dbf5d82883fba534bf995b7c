The Coega Development Corporation (CDC), operator of the award winning Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ) announced on Thursday, that over 452 much needed jobs have been created as a result of the booming construction in the SEZ.The projects currently at various phases of construction include the (1) Customs Control Area (CCA), (2) BAIC Ring Road Project, (3) BAIC construction site (Automotive sector) all of which are in Zone 1, (4) MM Engineering (Energy Sector) in Zone 3, (5) Kenako Construction and (6) Osho Cement (Metals sector) both of which are in Zone 5. The CDC has worked tirelessly over the years to ensure that, on the one hand, we create employment opportunities for our people and on the other hand we diversify our sectors in order to address the scourge of unemployment and poverty in the EC, says Dr Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC unit head marketing &amp; communications.The announcement by the CDC follows the recently released Poverty Trends in South Africa report by Statistics South Africa this week, which raised alarming stats on the poverty levels of the country with a staggering 55% (30,4 million South Africans) of the population living in poverty. We are certainly alive to and mindful of our role in society and the mandate in terms of socio economic development, given the environment under which we operate. Therefore, every job created is critical in putting food on the table of many of our citizens who rely on the opportunities provided by the Coega SEZ through these projects, adds Dr Vilakazi.Projects and job opportunitiesProject NameZoneNumber employedCustoms Control Area (CCA)Zone 1 90MM EngineeringZone 389BAIC Ring Road Project inZone 14BAIC Construction siteZone 1144Kenako ConcreteZone 576OSHO CementZone 549Total452 Emerging contractors play an integral part to sustainable development and this is achieved through the CDC s SMME capacitation programme.
