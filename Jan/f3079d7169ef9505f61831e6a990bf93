Employees from the Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) and the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Budget and Treasury Directorate thwarted the efforts from attempted swindlers to siphon money from the city s coffers.MBDA officials received an e-mail and a phone call from a fraudster claiming to be Bevan Zwane, a treasury official from the municipality, stating that the municipal banking account has changed. Money owed to the municipality by MBDA must therefore be sent to this new account.Fully aware that such a serious matter will not be loosely announced by the municipality, interaction with our treasury officials brought the momentum of this unholy enterprise to a screeching halt.Fake information such as a fictitious name for the municipality s Chief Financial Officer, the address of its Budget and Treasury division, the fake banking details and the incorrect application of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality logo stood out like a sore thumb. A case has been opened by the South African Police Services and Standard Bank has been alerted.Residents are advised to note that ABSA Bank was officially appointed as the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality bankers from 1 November 2012, following a rigorous tender process.The correct account details for municipal accounts are:Please note that traffic fines can be paid into 40-7953-3826 (also ABSA) with the same branch code as above with the traffic fine number as the reference.Residents are further requested to remain vigilant and report attempts of fraud at their nearest Police Station and the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality s Ethics and Corruption hotline at 0800 007 086 or by sending an email to [email&#160;protected] .
