Two alleged armed robbers will appear in court on Wednesday after they were arrested shortly after allegedly opening fire on police in Kwadwesi, Port Elizabeth, at about 21:30 on Sunday night.According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the incident happened as officers from the Kwadwesi police station and the Motherwell Operational Command Centre were in the area of Joe Slovo, in Kwadwesi, performing crime prevention duties."A white Quantum minibus was spotted without number plates, and when police attempted to pull it from the road, another white Quantum minibus came from another direction and fired four shots at the police, which struck the bonnet of the Kwadwesi vehicle," he described."The other police vehicles in the area rushed to assist and after a short vehicle chase in Melumzi Street, both mini busses were cornered and the two drivers, aged 29 and 25, were arrested."Unfortunately, about three to four other suspects, who were in the vehicles managed to evade arrest."Only after arresting the suspects, it was realised that these were the suspects, who robbed a truck in the same street of diesel an hour earlier."They gun pointed a security guard and stole diesel from the truck at 20:30," said Cpt Beetge."Both suspects will appear in the New Brighton Magistrates Court on 28 June 2017 on charges of armed robbery and attempted murder."
