The Grahamstown High Court last week sentenced a 26-year-old man to two life terms for murder plus an additional 10 years imprisonment for attempted murder. "The sentences will be served concurrently," said police spokesperson, Captain Lariane Jonker."This relates to an incident that occurred on 8 August 2016, at about 02:40, when the accused, Sipho Maurice Mtwebana, shot his ex-girlfriend, a 22-year-old woman as well as her 22 and 25-year-old male companions."Captain Jonker said that Mtwebana met the three friends in a passage that connected Nyanda Street and Sikulu Street in the Lingelihle Township of Cradock. "The ex-girlfriend survived after a bullet only grazed through her hair, but her two male companions were both killed," she said. "The accused was arrested shortly after the incident, abandoned the bail application and was subsequently kept in custody until the case was transferred to the Grahamstown High Court."
