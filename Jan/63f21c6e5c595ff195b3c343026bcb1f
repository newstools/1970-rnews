A clean audit over the new few years has today become a much stronger possibility for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality following the Audit Action Plan for the institution announced at a press conference on Thursday.The press briefing was attended by Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Human Settlements MMC Cllr Nqaba Bhanga, MPAC Chairperson Cllr Lance Grootboom, Finance MMC Cllr Retief Odendaal, and Constituency Services MMC Cllr Shirley Sauls.The outcomes of the 2015/16 AG Report made it clear that drastic intervention was necessary, and Budget and Treasury MMC, Cllr Retief Odendaal, and his team of officials were tasked by the new leadership to draw up an audit action plan to ensure that the Municipality achieves a clean audit over the next few years."We are happy to share with the people of the metro that we have already made progress within a year, in a damage that has been done for more than 15 years. We are working hard to realise a clean audit, but we are aware that there is still a lot that needs to be done. The turnaround strategies put in place are already showing clear signs of success," said Councillor Odendal. The Municipal Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Cllr Lance Grootboom, will ensure that this Plan is rolled out as intended. This "watchdog" committee will fulfil its mandate by conducting oversight over the Municipality's officials in adhering to the Action Plan.A key concern in the outcomes of the 2015/16 AG Report, was the fairness and transparency of procurement processes; this has been addressed through proper record-keeping and controls, and proper access control.Procurement and contract management procedures have generally been tightened to ensure compliance with SCM regulations; for example, in inviting competitive bidding in respect of goods and services of a transactional value of above R200 000, and ensuring that construction contracts are awarded to contractors that are registered with the CIDB. Ensuring sound financial planning and a solid budget, the institution will be able to deliver better services, as promised by Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip.Housing developments, which will provide thousands of housing opportunities over the next three years, will start once illegal structures have been removed from earmarked land by the SAPS and the Sheriff. Human Settlements MMC, Cllr Nqaba Bhanga, has committed to delivering houses, along with title deeds, to those residents who have been waiting for decades."As a City, we are pleased with the team work and understanding that we have recieved from law abiding citizens of the city. We are now in the final stages of evictions, as instructed by the sheriff of court."We are pleased to say that we have committed to realise a dream of a 75 year old who has been waiting for a house for more than 20 years and that is the promise we will keep," said Councillor Bhanga. The housing list is currently being scrutinised in terms of an intensive top level forensic audit, and will soon, in August 2017, be relaunched as a publicly available, fair and transparent list.Against the backdrop of prudent financial planning and better service and housing delivery, the Municipality has declared its commitment to being responsive to the needs of all people by successfully establishing 60 ward committees.Altogether 49 of its 60 wards, ward committees were on Wednesday selected through an electoral process, facilitated by the IEC.The balance of 11 ward committees were unopposed and therefore did not go to an election. MMC for Constituency Services, Cllr Shirley Sauls, has triumphed by ensuring that for the first time in many, many years, ward committees were selected by the people, for the people, to communicate our residents' needs, priorities and desires to the government at grass-root level.Please see the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality action plan for a clean audit HERE.
