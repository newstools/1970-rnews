This system is expected to bring very strong interior winds on Wednesday (7 June) possibly reaching gale force in places in the western and northern interior," described Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Services. "By the early hours of Thursday morning we might see some light snow on the Sneeuberg (Graaff-Reinet) through to the southern Drakensberg (Barkley East/Elliot area)."He said that Gale force Westerly winds can be expected along the south coast on Thursday with gusts of up to 100km/h possible in places."Please note that while some showers are expected along the south coast, most of the rain will impact on the Western Cape and not much can be expected over the Eastern Cape.
