The impasse between the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and SAMWU has been resolved following weeks of go-slow action by the Metro's Waste Management workers. "Their action severely affected refuse collection in the Metro and the Municipality was forced to use private refuse collection service providers to clean up the city as the backlog posed serious health risks to Metro residents," the municipality said. "As of today (Thursday), the strike is over and all Waste Management workers are back at work today to address the refuse collection backlog created during their protestant action." Both parties came to an agreement after the Municipality sent them a final letter of ultimatum. "Thus, the Municipality's final offer of 8 hours pay with 1 hour unpaid lunch, has been accepted, and the condition of ablution and dining facilities has been approved. "Refuse collection will be done in all the areas that are serviced on Thursdays and residents are encouraged to place their refuse bags and bins on the verge," the municipality said. "The Municipality has also made it clear that if today's rounds are not conducted in an acceptable and comprehensive manner, the relevant staff will be summarily dismissed."
