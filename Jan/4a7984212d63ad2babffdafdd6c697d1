Mounted policing in the Eastern Cape Province has re-emerged as an extremely relevant and effective way of policing."Our MountedUnit covers the largest policing jurisdiction in the province and contributes to maintaining law and order. Their responsibilities include rural crime scene searches, high visibility and targeted patrols, searches for missing persons, responding to anti-social behaviour issues, beach patrols at known trouble spots, highly mobile responses to crowd control gatherings and ceremonial functions," said Eastern Cape police."The added height and visibility that the horses give their riders allows officers to observe a wider area, but it also allows people in the wider area to see the officers in order to find officers when they need them."It is against this backdrop that the Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga, initiated a special project to capacitate the units in the province to ensure more policing specifically in our rural areas."The recruitment drive was initiated and more than 120 police officers applied.After an intensive fitness and introductory course, 14 members successfully passed the 1st phase. "After a seven week training course in Potchefstroom, our 14 fourteen horse riders successfully completed their session and received their certificates on the 23rd June 2017 at a Passing out Parade held at the SAPS Mounted Academy," police said."Members will be performing duties in Barkly East (newly established unit) and in East London (re-capacitating) of the unit."
