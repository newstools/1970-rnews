The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has implemented additional risk processes in the way that it pays out refunds to taxpayers. It is important for taxpayers expecting a refund to note that SARS has this year implemented additional risk processes to ensure both the legitimacy and accuracy of the refunds paid. SARS has an obligation to both taxpayers as well as to the fiscus to ensure that fraudulent and invalid claims are stopped, it said.This as the revenue service announced that as of 8am on Thursday it had received 341 356 returns.The majority, 243 388 were submitted using eFiling, while 97 968 have submitted at a SARS branch. We are aware that taxpayers have an expectation that once they submit a return which results in a refund that this would be paid to them shortly thereafter. It must though be noted that such refunds can only be paid once all SARS processes have been concluded. SARS is committed to ensure that legitimate refunds are paid as soon as possible. The 2017 tax season opened on 1 July 2017 for eFilers, while it opened on Monday for those filing their tax returns at SARS branches.Tax season is the single biggest annual engagement between ordinary citizens and SARS.
