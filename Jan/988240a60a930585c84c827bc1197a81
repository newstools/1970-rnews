Talks between the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and striking South African Municipal Workers' Union ( SAMWU ) -aligned workers, have not produced anything as the Union has refused to accept the Municipality's offer of 8 hours' pay, with an unpaid hour of lunch, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, said on Friday."As previously stated, this is our final offer. We will not be forced to pay 'incentive schemes' and 'completion bonuses' for work that is already remunerated at 8 hours of pay," the Mayor described."This is a legally compliant and commensurate salary in waste collection, and has been benchmarked against eThekwini and the City of Cape Town."Thus, we are proceeding with disciplinary action against every single striking staff member."Trollip said that in the mean time the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's contingency plan, through service providers, is picking up speed."Today, full rounds begin in our Metro's Northern Areas; that is both refuse bags and wheelie bins."Rounds will continue in all those areas and communities already serviced last week," he added."Motherwell, Wells Estate and surrounds are volatile due to violent protests, and thus cannot be serviced at this time. By Monday, we hope to have 100% of all rounds in operation."We are almost there. Again, thank you for your patience during this time."
