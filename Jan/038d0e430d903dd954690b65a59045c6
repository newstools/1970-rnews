The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday welcomed an investigation by the Independent Police Investigate Directorate (IPID) into what it called a Hollywood-style raid of the East London offices of star Hawks investigator, Captain Luphumlo Lwana, early this month.Captain Lwana, a detective in the commercial crimes unit of the Hawks, was the investigating officer on the now-infamous Buffalo City Municipality Nelson Mandela funeral scandal in which millions of rands are believed to have been squandered by connected inidividuals, who took advantage of the funeral of the late former President Nelson Mandela.He has made a name for himself for fearlessly pursuing and gathering evidence against powerful and politically-connected individuals in the province. Apparently, many files on high-profile cases involving powerful and political figures were taken in the raid."The investigation sets basis for the matter to be resolved in a manner that ensures that justice is not hindered," said Siyabonga Mdodi, SACP Eastern Cape Provincial Spokesperson."We believe that the IPID will act swiftly to restore the public confidence in the South African security cluster."Mdodi said that the SACP in the Eastern Cape reiterates on its "principled call that there should be no abuse of our state resources and our security apparatus for political criminality"."There should be no political protection of corruption perceived or real. As south Africans we should never allow what was done during the period of the Scorpions to be repeated," he added."We should rise in defence of our country and our hard-won democracy."
