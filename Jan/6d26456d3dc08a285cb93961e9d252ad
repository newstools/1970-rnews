With some local roads being in a dreadful state, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Roads and Transport Directorate happily celebrated the launch of two roads, namely Tromp Street in Missionvale and Chatty Link Road in Chatty on Monday.The Executive Mayor, Cllr Athol Trollip, was there to officially open both revamped roads.The day s events started in Missionvale, where the Municipality surfaced a gravel road in Tromp and Seibritz Roads. This R10 million roads project included full surfacing, with kerbing and channelling of storm water. Tromp Road is 720 m long, whilst Seibritz Road is 610 m long.The Chatty Link Road is a new road, linked to the Bloemendal Arterial Road and Stanford Road. It also provides safe pedestrian walkways for the people in these areas. This is another important illustration that this administration is committed to ensuring that the residents of Nelson Mandela Bay receive quality service delivery, said the Executive Mayor.The total construction value of this project amounted to R13 604 112.80. The work done, also included full surfacing, kerbing and channelling of storm water, as well as a premix pedestrian walkway along the one side of the road. The road is 1.48 km long. A total of 17 emerging contractors and local labour were sourced for the two projects. The construction of these two roads will go a long way in improving the conditions of life of the respective communities. Now that we have these roads, it will also be easy for emergency vehicles like ambulances, police and fire vehicles to access these areas quickly. It goes well with the present government's commitment to the creation of safer and caring communities, said Mayor Trollip.
