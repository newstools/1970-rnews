The highly intricate balancing act of growing the informal economy of the Nelson Mandela Bay by adequately accommodating the informal trading sector is high on the agenda of a two-day workshop at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Anele Qaba, Executive Director: Economic Development, Tourism and Agriculture of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, set the scene by reminding delegates that informal traders are largely left out in the cold."Essentially we are dealing with a city of two tales. On the one hand we have the Metro Police enforcing the bylaw and on the other hand, we have the succinct responsibility to develop informal traders economically and therefore cannot allow that they suffer."Those responsible for Land Planning must also take into account that we move traders from areas where they cannot sell their wares, Qaba said.Representatives from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, the South African Local Government Association (Salga), the Socio Economic Rights Institute (Seri) and numerous other delegates form part of the Informal Economy Policy and Strategy Development Workshop.Charles Parkerson, Salga s Director of Economic Development, said the purpose of the workshop is to develop broad guidelines that ultimately will be the basis to develop a policy to efficiently deal with street trade.The workshop starts shortly before 9am on Wednesday morning.
