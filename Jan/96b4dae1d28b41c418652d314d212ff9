The Panayiotou trial resumed in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday, where Judge Dalayin Chetty was set to give his ruling on the admissibility of a secret recording of murder accused, Christopher Panayiotou.Panayiotou, along with co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko, is accused of orchestrating the faked kidnapping and subsequent murder of his teacher wife, Jayde, in April 2015.The secret recording has been the highlight of the Panayiotou trial, where alleged middleman and former key State witness, Luthando Siyoni, is apparently heard talking to Panayiotou, who allegedly implicates himself in Jayde s murder.Defence Advocate, Terry Price, had strongly opposed the use of the recording in the trial stating that it be ruled inadmissible since Siyoni was allegedly badly beaten up by police prior to making contact with Panayiotou in the recordings.However, Judge Chetty ruled that the evidence was admissible.Tears of joy and sighs of relief could be heard from Jayde s family and those, who believe Panayiotou has a case to answer.The Court adjourned while State Prosecutor, Marius Stander, set up for the proceedings.It has not yet been confirmed if the secret recordings will be heard on Monday.
