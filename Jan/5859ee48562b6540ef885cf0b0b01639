Efforts to reduce the levels of serious crime in the Eastern Cape yielded resounding success when police seized dagga with estimated street value of R500 000 across the province in the past week alone.According to police spokesperson, Colonel Sibongile Soci, dagga with an estimated street value of R200 000 was found in Alicedale and a 49-year- old suspect was arrested and is expected to appear in court on Thursday facing a charge of possession of dagga."Ten bags of dagga with estimated street value of R100 000 were also confiscated in Mdantsane and a 61-year-old suspect was arrested and expected to appear in court soon," he said."Meanwhile, alert Grahamstown Highway patrol members also added one of the biggest dagga haul, when they intercepted 12 bags of dagga with an estimated street value of R120 000 during a vehicle check point."A 49- year -old suspect was arrested and is expected to appear in court soon."Colonel Soci said that valuable information from the community led King William s Town police to the recovery of ten bags of dagga with estimated street value of R100 000 in an unoccupied house. Police confiscated the drugs and no one was arrested."Our continued fight against proliferation of illegal firearms was given the thumbs up when at least 19 suspects were arrested for possession of illegal firearms and ammunition through covert anti-crime operations throughout the province," he added."These illegal weapons include 19 revolver firearms with 175 rounds of ammunition, one shotgun and one homemade gun. These firearms will be sent for ballistic tests to ascertain whether they have been previously used in the commission of crime."Colonel Soci said that the suspects are expected to appear in different courts of law facing charges of possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. Our strategy to fight trio crimes begins with ridding the streets of illegal firearms as these illegal firearms are mostly used in the commissioning of crime. The Cluster Operational Command Centres will continue to focus their efforts on trio crimes and the proliferation of drugs and firearms. These arrests and confiscations are the results thereof," said Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga.
